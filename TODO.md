# TODO

This document is essentially a list of shorthand notes describing work yet to be completed.
Unfortunately it is not complete enough for other people to pick work off the list and
complete as there is too much un-said.

* Start to introduce Clifford Algebra operations.

* Add a `ProjectUtil` that supports creating or modifying a matrix fro various project schemes.

* Add documentation somewhere that indicates all matrices in docs are in column-major form in documentation and toArray in OpenGL format. Top of Matrix class?
