# TODO

This document is essentially a list of shorthand notes describing work yet to be completed.
Unfortunately it is not complete enough for other people to pick work off the list and
complete as there is too much un-said.

* Start to introduce Clifford Algebra operations.

* Add Matrix4 element.

* Extract out `asString` from `toString()` methods so that they can persist even if toString is disabled.

* Add a `ProjectUtil` that supports creating or modifying a matrix fro various project schemes.
