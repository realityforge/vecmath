# Change Log

### Unreleased

* Add a compile time setting that controls whether the `Vector3f` overrides `Object.equals(Object)` and
  `Object.hashCode()` methods. These methods are very difficult for GWT and/or J2CL to optimize away but
  are rarely needed for geometric objects. The compile setting defaults to omitting these methods but still
  allows the applciation developer to opt-in to including the methods if required.
